# Real-World Applications Using Python
## E-commerce Recommendation System Using Advanced Data Structures

### Project Overview
This project demonstrates the practical application of fundamental data structures (hash tables, graphs, binary search trees, and n-ary trees) in building a comprehensive e-commerce recommendation system. The implementation showcases how different data structures can be integrated to solve complex real-world problems efficiently.

### Phase 1: Design and Implementation ✅
- **Hash Table**: User profile management with O(1) lookup performance
- **Graph**: Product similarity network for collaborative filtering
- **Binary Search Tree**: User behavior tracking with chronological ordering
- **N-ary Tree**: Category hierarchy for content-based recommendations
- **Integration**: Unified recommendation engine combining all components

### Phase 2: Proof of Concept Implementation ✅
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 25+ test methods across 6 test classes
- **Interactive Demo**: CLI interface with 9 main functionality areas
- **Performance Analysis**: Benchmarking and optimization validation
- **Documentation**: Detailed implementation notes and academic report
